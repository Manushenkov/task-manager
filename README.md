An effort was put into making the app accessible, it's usable with keyboard only

I added eslint-plugin-react to sort props and eslint-plugin-import to sort imports, this speeds up code review and reduces manual work
I added prettier
I added husky

react-error-boundary package is used because it's suggested in react docs
